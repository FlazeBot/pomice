# Installation

This library is designed to work with the Lavalink audio delivery system,
which directly interfaces with Discord to provide buttery smooth audio without
wasting your precious system resources. 

Pomice is made with convenience to the user, in that everything is easy to use
and is out of your way, while also being customizable.

In order to start using this library, please download a Lavalink node to start, 
you can get it [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/latest)

After you have your Lavalink node set up, you can install Pomice:

```
pip install pomice
```

Pomice will handle installing all required dependencies for you so you can
start coding with it without a hitch.

After you installed Pomice, get familiar with how it works by starting out with [an example.](quickstart.md)

If you need more than just a quick example, get our drop-in [advanced cog](https://github.com/cloudwithax/pomice/blob/main/examples/advanced.py) 
to take advantage of all of Pomice's features. 
You are free to use this as a base to add on to for any music features you want to implement within your application.

If you want to use anything outside the provided examples, refer to the [API Reference](api/index.md) section.
